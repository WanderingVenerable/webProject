       <h2>About Me</h2>
Hey there! I<sup>'</sup>m a high school student who<sup>'</sup>s passionate about coding, and this is one of my first projects I<sup>'</sup>ve built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It<sup>'</sup>s a simple number guessing game that I put together to challenge myself and have some fun with coding.
<br>

<h2>The Idea:</h2>
<br>
The game randomly generates a number, and your job is to guess it. With each guess, it<sup>'</sup>ll tell you if you're getting close or if you're way off. It<sup>'</sup>s a straightforward concept, but it<sup>'</sup>s been a cool way to practice my skills and see how code can create something interactive and enjoyable.
<br>
<br>
<h2> I Built It:</h2>
<br>
I<sup>'</sup>ve been learning the basics of web development and wanted to create something small but meaningful. I figured a number guessing game would be a good starting point â€” it<sup>'</sup>s easy to play, fun to build, and I get to see how far I<sup>'</sup>ve come with my coding journey. Plus, it's a great way to test my understanding of JavaScript's logic and functionality.

I hope you enjoy playing it! This project might be simple, but it<sup>'</sup>s a big step for me in my learning process, and I<sup>'</sup>m excited to keep improving and building even cooler things in the future.

Thanks for checking it out!
